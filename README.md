The dataset contains two different types of X-ray images of normal and corona infected patients respectively.
I have used CNN and mlp's to create my model.
Aim of the model is to classify a given X-ray image into one of the two classes 'Covid':0 and 'Normal':1.
The model was able to give almost 97% accuracy on training data and 98% accuracy on validation data.
